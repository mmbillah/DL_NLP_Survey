## Topic for Survey Paper:

Deep learning in the field of natural language processing (NLP).

## Reason for Selection:

  * For the semester project, I chose an active Kaggle competetion which will require the application of standard depp neural network. I have some prior knowledge about deep learning and I believe writing a survey paper on this topic will help me strengthen my understanding of this topic as well as broaden my overview of the field.
  
  * Alogside computer vision, NLP is a growing field where deep learning is being used significantly. I have some basic knowledge about the sequence models and I believe focusing on NLP as the survey paper topic will provide with me some helpful insights.
